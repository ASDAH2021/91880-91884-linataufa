<p> Psalms 23:1-6 "The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his nameâ€™s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley,I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever."</p>

  <div class="slideTwo" >Important information about myself is my side job. My part time job is a hustler, a money hustler. I always ask for $2 because I always have no food. Not only is it just me in this job but also my other hustler. We have a company called "Got $2's" and our slogan is "We'll pay you back". We are very famous for the job we do in school. Sometimes people get annoyed of us asking for money, but we don't care because we always have no food and we get hungry very fast. So if we catch you with food or by the canteen, keep in mind we will be asking for your money. I hope whoever is reading this gives me $2 for lunch, peace :)</div><!--slideTwo-->
