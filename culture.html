    <div class="slideOne"><p>I am a Tongan. I am from the kingdom of Tonga. My villages are Longoteme and Fahefa, Kalaa'u. Coming from such a prideful & happy culture, im truly grateful. I am a happy polynesian. I am happy for the culture I am. Im proud to be the tongan little lady I am today. Tongans are actually good people when you treat them like they ain't predators of the world. They are all about fun. My people come from nothing and wishing to succeed to be something. Thats really all a tongans dream. To succeed and be a someone when everyone wishes them to fail because of how they were raised and brought up. I am one of a tongan generation to change the view of other cultures that we can achieve anything even with the background we have.</p> <p>PROUD OF WHO I AM AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALWAYS ! </p></div><!--slideOne-->

    <div class="slideTwo"><p>One of the many traditional things in my culture are the dances. Dancing in our culture is very important. We are a culture of many talents. This picture on the right is a photo of our main traditional dances. This is a tau'olunga. The tau'olunga is a dance for single young woman, especially for them to show off on their wedding day. It is rare, but not impossible for a married couple or an older woman to do a tau'olunga. The tau ªolunga mainly consists of a series of hand movements, which interpret the meaning of the selected song. Our dances are not only always just woman dancing, family and friends of the dancer can be praised with money and more dances from her loved ones. Tau'olunga is to show care towards another important in the family or an important person in general. </p>
    <p> as other tongans know we always spark our dancing girls with oil. It is mainly used to 'shine bright like a diamond' for performances at any occasion. You'll mainly see dancers drenched in baby oil when they are performing any Pacific dance. </p>
    <p> It isn't that difficult to tau'olunga, but the main key to our dances for the girls is the GENTLENESS ! </p></div><!--slideTwo-->
